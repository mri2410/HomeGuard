<p>Visitor Detection and Alert System</p>
<p>Authors: Yihan Pang, Mohammad Islam, and Arun Rai </p>
===============================

Project Overview
========================
The Home Visitors Detection and Alert System is designed to detect visitors coming to a house, take their pictures, and send the host (the homeowner) an email message with the pictures. The system also allows the visitor to leave a text message or an email to the host by using a keyboard and a screen monitor that are installed at the entrance door. The goal of this system design is that, while being away from the home, the host can still keep track of his visitors.  When the host is away from the home, there are chances of property theft and/or destruction. This device, if installed properly, can provide the user with valuable information of the suspects. The system automatically triggers the camera to take the pictures of the visitors when the visitors are active in front of the door longer than three seconds and sends them to the host. Then the host can take action, if necessary.

Acknowledgement
========================
We would like to use this opportunity to thanks Dr. William Plymale and Thaddeus Czauski for approving us to work on this project as our final team project as we learned and enhanced our knowledge on programming network applications. We also like to thank ECE Department of Virginia Tech for generously supporting us with the equipment we need for this project.  In the end, we also thanks the our entire classmates who generously help us on class forum on questions that we encountered in this project. Thanks you all and hope you all have a good winter break.
